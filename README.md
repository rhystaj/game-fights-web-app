# Game Fights Web App

## Overview
Game Fights is a debate style competition where a judge chooses a set of topics in the form of questions. Participants are given time to prepare thier answers, which they submit before the match starts, for the judge to decide whether they deem them to be acceptable. On a set date, a match takes place where participants debate the questions posed by the judge, arguing for the answer they submitted. For each question, a point is awarded for the player who gives the most convincing argument. The player with the most points by the end of the match wins. The Game Fights match manager is being developed as a way to facilitate all parts of this process.

## Versions
### 1.0 - The Essentials
The first version will contain what can be viewed as only the most essential features. A user will be able to create a match as a judge, only supporting indivdual participants - support for teams is planned to be added later. From there they will be able to post questions which the particpants will be able to see. 

When the judge allows it, participants will be able to submit answers to questions which the judge can accept or decline. After the match itself takes place, the judge will be able to enter the results of the match.

## The Stack
The front-end of the application is being developed with typescript and React, and styled using SCSS. A technology for the back-end has not been fully decided on yet, but it will likely be implemented using ASP.NET and SQL.
